# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This end-to-end machine learning project predicts **wine quality scores** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. It covers:

✅ Clean Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling
✅ GridSearchCV-based Hyperparameter Tuning
✅ Evaluation Metrics + Confusion Matrix
✅ SHAP Explainability for Predictions
✅ Real-time Streamlit App Interface
✅ Docker & GitHub CI/CD Integration

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitkharche/Classification_Wine_Quality_KNN_Streamlit.git
cd Classification_Wine_Quality_KNN_Streamlit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
# With GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
python scripts/train.py --use_grid_search

# Or with default K=5
python scripts/train.py
```

### 4. Evaluate the Model

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

### 5. Launch Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

## Streamlit App Features

### Predict Tab

* Responsive **3-column layout** for entering wine features
* Predicts wine `quality` score using the trained KNN model
* SHAP **waterfall plot** to explain individual prediction
* Compact SHAP visuals (6x4") with top 8 feature impacts

### Dashboard Tab

* **Confusion Matrix** heatmap with larger font for clarity
* **Classification Report** shown as a styled table
* Evaluates model performance across full dataset

## SHAP Explainability

* `shap.Explainer()` used with KNN model for interpretability
* Highlights which features most influenced the predicted score
* Waterfall plot helps understand individual predictions

---

## Docker Setup

### Manual Docker Build

```bash
docker build -t wine-knn-app .
docker run -p 8501:8501 wine-knn-app
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Your CI pipeline can:

* Automatically retrain the model
* Generate evaluation metrics
* Be extended to include testing, linting, deployment

Located at:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

---

## Dataset Information

* **Source**: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
* **Features**: acidity, chlorides, alcohol, pH, etc.
* **Target**: Wine `quality` (integer values)

---

## Future Enhancements

* [ ] Compare KNN with RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost
* [ ] Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces deployment
* [ ] MLflow tracking integration
* [ ] Add LIME or SHAP bar visualizations
* [ ] REST API with FastAPI or Flask
